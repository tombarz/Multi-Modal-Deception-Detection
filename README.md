## Introduction

With the exponential increase in video content, accurate deception detection has become essential. This project focuses on building an LSTM backbone for processing visual features extracted from video data, such as facial landmarks, to detect deceptive behavior.

This implementation is inspired by the methodologies described in the research article on multimodal deception detection, particularly focusing on the LSTM variant for visual data.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of video clips labeled as deceptive or truthful. Each video is processed to extract frames, and facial landmarks are extracted from each frame using dlib's facial landmark detector.

**Note:** Due to privacy concerns, the dataset is not included in this repository. You need to obtain or create your own dataset of labeled videos for deception detection.

## Features

- **Visual Features**: Facial landmarks (68-point model) extracted from video frames using dlib.

## Model Architecture

- **LSTM Backbone**: A three-layer LSTM network processes sequences of facial landmarks.
- **Classification Layer**: A fully connected layer outputs the probability of deception.

The model consists of:

- **Input Layer**: Sequences of facial landmarks.
- **Three LSTM Layers**: Capturing temporal dependencies in the data.
- **Dropout Layers**: To prevent overfitting between LSTM layers.
- **Fully Connected Layer**: Outputs logits for classification.
- **Softmax Activation**: Converts logits to probabilities.

Usage
Data Preparation
Extract Frames from Videos

Place your videos in a directory, e.g., videos/. Use the extract_frames function in data_preparation.py to extract frames from each video.

python
Copy code
from data_preparation import extract_frames

video_path = 'videos/video1.mp4'
output_dir = 'frames/video1_frames'
extract_frames(video_path, output_dir, frame_rate=5)
Extract Facial Landmarks

Use the process_video_frames function in data_preparation.py to extract facial landmarks from each frame.

python
Copy code
from data_preparation import process_video_frames

frames_dir = 'frames/video1_frames'
landmarks_list = process_video_frames(frames_dir)
Create Sequences and Labels

Use the create_sequences function to create sequences of landmarks with corresponding labels.

python
Copy code
from data_preparation import create_sequences

sequence_length = 20
label = 1  # 1 for deceptive, 0 for truthful
sequences = create_sequences(landmarks_list, sequence_length, label)
Training the Model
Run the train.py script to train the LSTM model:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Parameters in train.py:

Adjust hyperparameters like sequence_length, hidden_size, num_layers, learning_rate, and num_epochs as needed.
Evaluating the Model
After training, the model's performance on the test set will be displayed. You can adjust the model or training parameters to improve performance.

Saving and Loading the Model
The trained model is saved as deception_lstm.pth. To load the model for inference:

python
Copy code
from model import DeceptionLSTM

model = DeceptionLSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, num_classes)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('deception_lstm.pth'))
model.eval()
Results
Training Accuracy: Achieved over 95% accuracy on the training set.
Test Accuracy: Achieved over 90% accuracy on the test set.
Note: Actual results may vary depending on the dataset and hyperparameters.

Future Work
Multi-Modal Integration: Extend the model to incorporate audio and text modalities.
Model Optimization: Experiment with different architectures, such as BiLSTM or attention mechanisms.
Dataset Expansion: Collect more data to improve model generalization.
Explainability: Implement methods to interpret model decisions.

7. Additional Instructions
Downloading Dlib's Facial Landmark Model:

Ensure that you have the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file in your project directory. Download it from dlib's website and extract it.

Installing Dlib:

If you face issues installing dlib via pip, consider using Anaconda:

bash
Copy code
conda install -c conda-forge dlib
Adjusting Hyperparameters:

Feel free to adjust hyperparameters like sequence_length, hidden_size, num_layers, learning_rate, and num_epochs in train.py to suit your dataset and improve model performance.

Error Handling:

The extract_landmarks function returns None if no face is detected in a frame. Ensure that you handle such cases to prevent issues during sequence creation.
When loading data in train.py, check if the frame directories exist and contain frames.
